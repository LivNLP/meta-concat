# PIP-concat
Creates meta embedding via unsupervised PIP loss minimisation
This branch holds code base for loading co-occurrence matrices computed externally. This is needed because the corpus branch would not be able to create matrices from large (more than 1G of text) or for large vocabularies (more than 15K words).
